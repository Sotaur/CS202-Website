        <h3>Computers and Accounts</h3>

        <p>The Computer Science Dept. provides computers that you may use for your programming assignments. The Linux computer labs are located on the first floor and in the basement of the Talmage Building. You will need a Computer Science Dept. computer
            account in order to access these machines. (This account is different than your Route-Y account.) If you do not already have a Computer Science Dept. account, go to the web page at the following link to create or enable your account.</p>

        <p>Your CS computer account can be set up here: <a href="https://accounts.cs.byu.edu/">accounts.cs.byu.edu</a><br> Account setup instructions are here: <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=setting-up-your-account-with-the-cs-authentication-system">Setting Up Your Account</a>
        </p>

        <p>Abuse of BYU computers, networks, or facilities involving either pornography or illegal activity will result in loss of all Computer Science accounts and removal from all CS classes. Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=account-policies-lab-rules">CS Dept.
Lab Rules and Policies</a> for information regarding appropriate lab, computer, and account use. If you prefer, you can watch this entertaining video to learn about our lab policies:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisrJqzAWOc">Lab Policies Video</a> You will be held accountable for understanding and abiding by these policies.
        </p>

        <p>If you would like to access the CS Dept. computers remotely, you can find instructions for doing so here: <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=vpn-configuration-and-use">Remote VPN Access</a>
        </p>

        <h3>CS Dept. Retake Policy (The Two Strikes Policy)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Students are allowed only one retake of any class. If a student withdraws from or fails a class a second time, the student will not be allowed to register for any CS course for one semester (or one term, if in spring or summer). This policy does not apply
                to classes dropped before the add/drop deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                After one semester (or term), a student must petition to be allowed to take CS courses again. The petition must provide evidence of a substantive change that makes success in future CS classes much more likely. For example, a student may have demonstrated
                success in technology, math, or science-based courses. The petition will be reviewed by the undergraduate advisor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Petitions for non-academic (e.g., medical or military) exceptions to the one semester/term waiting period may be granted according to university policies. Information about filing a petition can be found here:
                <a href="https://cs.byu.edu/retake-policy">CS Dept. Retake Policy</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Honor Code Standards</h3>

        <p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that
            of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university.</p>

        <p>Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and my own expectation
            in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

        <h3>Harassment</h3>

        <p>Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically, BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the university but to students as well. If you encounter sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other
            inappropriate behavior, please talk to your professor, contact the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at 422-2847.</p>

        <h3>Disabilities</h3>

        <p>BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services
            deemed appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by that office.</p>

        <h3>Children in the Classroom</h3>

        <p>The serious study of the physical and mathematical sciences requires uninterrupted concentration and focus in the classroom. Having small children in class is often a distraction that degrades the educational experience for the entire class. Please
            make other arrangements for child care rather than bringing children to class with you. If there are extenuating circumstances, please talk with your instructor in advance.
